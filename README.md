# obfus.h

**[obfus.h](https://github.com/DosX-dev/obfus.h/blob/main/include/obfus.h)** is a macro-only library for compile-time obfuscating C applications, designed specifically for the **[Tiny C (tcc)](https://bellard.org/tcc/)**. It is tailored for Windows x86 and x64 platforms and supports almost all versions of the compiler. **Very reliable armor for your C programs!**

### What features does it have?...
- üîç **Function Call Obfuscation**: Confuse function calls to make your code less readable to unauthorized eyes.
- üõ°Ô∏è **Anti-Debugging Techniques**: Built-in mechanisms to prevent code analysis during runtime.
- üîÑ **Control Flow Code Mutation**: Turns code into spaghetti, making it difficult to parse conditions and loops.
- üö´ **Anti-Decompilation Techniques**: Makes many popular decompilers useless visually breaking their output.
- üòà **Fake Signatures Adding**: Can add fake signatures of various packers and protectors to confuse reverse engineers.
- üß† **Virtualization**: Makes math operations very difficult to understand using virtual machine commands.

## üëæ Usage

Integrating **[obfus.h](https://github.com/DosX-dev/obfus.h/blob/main/include/obfus.h)** into your project is a simple process. Just include the following line in your code:
```c
#include "obfus.h"
```
This will automatically obfuscate your code during compilation, ensuring protection and confidentiality of your intellectual property.

> Available options for protection configuring:
> ```c
> // Additional options
> #define cflow_v2       1  // More powerful Control Flow obfuscation (slowly!)
> #define antidebug_v2   1  // Use better dynamic anti-debugging protection
> #define fake_signs     1  // Adds fake signatures of various protectors or packers
> 
> // Advanced code protection (see the "Virtualization" part of the documentation!)
> #define virt           1  // Allows you to use the functions of a math VM
> 
> // Disabling default features
> #define no_cflow       1  // Don't use Control-Flow obfuscation
> #define no_antidebug   1  // Don't build in debugging protection
> ```
> or use it with compiler args:
> 
> ```
> tcc "app.c" -w  -D no_cflow  -D antidebug_v2  -D fake_signs
> ```

‚ö†Ô∏è When compiling an application with obfuscation, use the `-w` argument to suppress warnings. Otherwise, the console will display numerous intimidating logs that have no impact on the final result. There's no need to be alarmed by them.

üîê Debugging protection is triggered by calls to many basic MSVCRT functions.
In critical places in the code you can use the `ANTI_DEBUG;` construct. For example:
```c
ANTI_DEBUG;
if (!licenseExpired()) {
    // ...
}
```

## üë∫ Virtualization
This is a protection technique in which certain calculations are performed through an embedded virtual machine upon command. Makes analysis of mathematical operations **very difficult**! It will work with the `virt` option enabled (and only!). Otherwise, all virtual machine commands will be replaced by ordinary mathematical operators.

‚ö†Ô∏è Virtualization in critical locations can impact optimization. Use with caution only in areas where it is really needed

A simple example of using virtualization::
```c
// ...
#define virt 1
// ...

if (VM_EQU(VM_ADD(2, 2), 4)) {
    printf("2 + 2 == 4!");
}

```

You can find examples of using all the functions of a virtual machine in the file [tests/virtualmachine.c](tests/virtualmachine.c)

## ‚ùì Example of using
If you need advanced protection against skilled reversers, use `cflow_v2` and `antidebug_v2` options.
```c
// Let's obfuscate your code!

#include <stdio.h>

#define virt         1 // [+] Use math virtual machine

#define cflow_v2     1 // [+] ControlFlow v2
#define fake_signs   1 // [+] Fake signatures
#define antidebug_v2 1 // [+] AntiDebug v2

#define no_cflow     0 // [-] Disable ControlFlow
#define no_antidebug 0 // [-] Disable AntiDebug


#include "obfus.h"

void main() {
    char *out = malloc(256);

    strcpy(out, "Hello, world!\n");

    if (out) {
        printf(out);
    } else {
        printf("Error!\n");
    }


    int result = VM_ADD(5, 7); // 5 + 7

    if (VM_EQU(result, 12)) { // (5 + 7) == 12
        printf("5 + 7 == 12");
    }
}
```

## üõ† Compiler (important)
The latest version of **Tiny C** (`0.9.27`) is recommended for use. Unfortunately, some versions of the compiler do not support the functionality needed to completely obfuscation. **Visual C**, **GCC** and **Clang** *is not supported* and is unlikely to be supported.

## üìñ Summarize
The code of a program (and its original original logic) protected using **[obfus.h](https://github.com/DosX-dev/obfus.h/blob/main/include/obfus.h)** is almost **impossible to recover (deobfuscate)**. However, using this obfuscator does not guarantee complete protection against all types of threats. **It's important to develop and maintain internal program security systems.**

// BEFORE OBFUSCATION       
__int64 sub_4010B8() {
    printf("Hello, world!");
    return 0i64;
}
```

```c
// AFTER OBFUSCATION
 __int64 sub_401000() {
     *(_DWORD *)(a2 + v2) += v2;
     if ( !(_DWORD)a2 )
       JUMPOUT(0x100C3C9);
     MEMORY[0x100C3C9] &= a2;
     return (loc_4017B1)(asc_404159);
 }
